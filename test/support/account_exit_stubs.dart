/// The four overrides every widget test reaching an account exit needs.
///
/// `deregisterThisDevice` forgets everything the session cached locally, and
/// each of the four fails a DIFFERENT way without an override. The image
/// loader resolves the platform cache directory through `path_provider`, and a
/// method channel never completes under `testWidgets`' fake clock — so the real
/// one makes the test HANG until its timeout rather than fail, with no error
/// naming the cause. The two repositories resolve `FirebaseFirestore.instance`
/// when their providers are READ (which `DeviceDeregistrationDeps.from` does),
/// so they throw `[core/no-app]` on construction before any teardown step runs.
///
/// `.claude/rules/testing.md` documented all three copies of this trio BY NAME
/// and stated that failure mode, which is the tell that it wanted one owner:
/// the rule had to list where each copy lived because there was nowhere to
/// point instead. Three files spelled it out — two of them byte-identical apart
/// from a class prefix, the third the recording variant — and the cost of a
/// fourth getting it subtly wrong is a hang with nothing in the output.
///
/// Pass [calls] to RECORD the teardown order (`'imageCache'`, `'clients'`,
/// `'appointments'`); leave it null for silent stubs. That is the only
/// difference between the two variants this replaces, so it is the only knob.
