/**
 * @fileoverview Propagates client-doc edits (name/phone/address) onto that
 * client's FUTURE denormalized appointment copies, so an edit doesn't leave
 * the calendar showing stale data (client-side finding C8).
 *
 * Semantics (mirrors the app's own rules):
 *   - `clientName` / `clientPhone` are always overwritten with the client's
 *     current values. `clientName` is the DISPLAY name — the stored
 *     `clients/{id}.name` carries the phone number on the end for Wave's
 *     benefit, and `clientDisplayName` (`client_name_utils.js`) takes it back
 *     off. Without that strip a client edit would fan "Marc Tremblay
 *     (514) 555-1234" onto every future appointment card, disagreeing with
 *     the clean name the app itself writes at booking time.
 *   - `address` follows the client only when the appointment's stored address
 *     still equals the client's previous (non-empty) address — a differing
 *     or empty address is treated as custom/none and left untouched.
 *     Both sides are the COMPOSED address (`composeFullAddress`), never the
 *     stored `clients/{id}.address`, and that is load-bearing twice over.
 *     An appointment carries ONE address string and no city/province/postal
 *     of its own, so fanning the stored street line onto it would strip the
 *     locality off a live job with nothing left to rebuild it from — and
 *     normalizing the client field (street-only) has to stay a NO-OP here,
 *     which it is, because both shapes compose to the same string. It also
 *     fixes a matching bug that predates the split, in BOTH its halves: a city
 *     or postal edit never touched `address` and so reached no appointment at
 *     all; and an apt-bearing client never matched `from`, because the app
 *     books the DISPLAY spelling ("1234 Rue X #4, …") while this side composed
 *     the canonical one ("4-1234 Rue X, …").
 *     The apt half needed `composeFullAddress` to re-spell the apt the way the
 *     app does — it does now, via `canonicalToDisplay`, and that is required
 *     rather than cosmetic BECAUSE the comparison below is verbatim. Composing
 *     on both sides was necessary but not sufficient; the two composers also
 *     have to agree character for character. Their tests share worked examples
 *     for exactly this reason — each side used to assert its own composer
 *     against itself, which is how the divergence survived a release.
 *   - Only appointments with WORK LEFT are rewritten — history records what
 *     was true at the time of the visit. That is `endTime >= now`, NOT
 *     `startTime >= now`: under the daily-window model a run started up to
 *     MAX_APPOINTMENT_SPAN_DAYS ago can still have days of work left, and
 *     gating on the start meant a client's corrected phone or suite number
 *     never reached a crew that was already on site. Firestore can only take
 *     the one inequality that matches the index, so the QUERY floor is widened
 *     by the span and the real endTime test is applied in code below.
 *
 * Every write is an absolute value, so this is idempotent and the trigger
 * runs with `retry: true`. Updates go out in WriteBatches of ≤500 (the
 * Firestore hard limit).
 *
 * Requires the composite index `(clientId ASC, startTime ASC)` on
 * `appointments` (declared in firestore.indexes.json).
 *
