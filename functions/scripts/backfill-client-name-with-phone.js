// One-off: makes each PERSON's `name` their phone number and nothing else, so
// the Wave customer reads "(514) 555-1234". A BUSINESS is left alone.
//
// WHY: `name` is synced VERBATIM as the Wave CUSTOMER name
// (`toWaveCustomerInput`, `wave/mappers.js`), and the invoicing workflow there
// identifies people by number. Owner call 2026-08-14. This supersedes both the
// "<name> <number>" shape this script wrote before and
// `backfill-client-phone-from-name.js`, which ran against prod on 2026-08-08.
// The rule lives in `ClientNamePolicy`, hand-mirrored as
// `client_name_utils.js`; this is the data half of it.
//
// THE RULE, per doc:
//   1. Skip any client created ON OR AFTER --since (default 2026-08-08, the
//      day the first rename ran). "Don't touch the ones that were just added" —
//      owner call. A doc with NO `createdAt` is treated as OLD and patched:
//      the field is backfilled lazily, so its absence means legacy, not new.
//   2. Skip any client with no phone AND no mobile. There is no number to be
//      named after, and nothing about the doc is wrong.
//   3. SKIP ANY BUSINESS — its name IS its identity in Wave ("3101-5696 qc
//      inc.", "1505 Village de Bergerac"), a number in its place is
//      unrecognisable on an invoice, and unlike a person there is usually no
//      first/last for the app to fall back on.
//   4. Otherwise set `name` to the phone (or the mobile). Trivially IDEMPOTENT:
//      a second run computes the same number, finds it already stored, and
//      writes nothing.
//
// RULE 3 IS A HEURISTIC AND THE DRY RUN LISTS EVERY DOC IT MATCHED. The Wave
// import sets no `type`, so an imported business can only be recognised by its
// NAME — a leading digit, or a company token like "inc"/"ltée"/"enr". Read
// that list before going live: a PERSON wrongly matched keeps their name (no
// harm), but a BUSINESS wrongly missed is renamed on live invoices.
//
// The clients it renames that had NO first/last on file are listed too, and
// that list needs reading for a different reason: their stored `name` was the
// only copy of the person's name, so the patch SPLITS it into the two halves
// in the same write rather than overwriting it away. The split is mechanical
// — last whitespace token is the surname — so only a human can spot a
// mis-split. (This used to be silent data loss; docs renamed before that was
// fixed are repaired by `restore-client-name-halves.js`.)
//
// TWO TRIGGERS FIRE ON EVERY PATCHED DOC, both wanted, neither free:
//   - `propagateClientEdits` fans the name onto that client's FUTURE
//     appointments. Harmless here and worth having: it writes the DISPLAY name
//     (`clientDisplayName` strips the number back off), so the appointment
//     copies converge on the same clean name the app writes at booking.
//   - `waveUpsertCustomer` enqueues an outbox job AND DRAINS IT IN THE SAME
//     INVOCATION (the 5-minute `waveSyncWorker` was deleted 2026-08-13). That
//     is the point of this script — but it means a few hundred Wave GraphQL
//     mutations fire within seconds of the last batch, against Wave's
//     60-calls/min ceiling. RUN THIS WHEN THE QUEUE IS QUIET and let it settle
//     before the next import; jobs that get rejected back off and are picked
//     up by the daily `runWaveDaily` drain, so nothing is lost, but a run in
//     the middle of a sync will be slow and noisy.
//
// Usage:
//   For prod:
//     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/prod-service-account.json
//     node functions/scripts/backfill-client-name-with-phone.js --dry-run
//     node functions/scripts/backfill-client-name-with-phone.js
//
//   For the local emulator:
//     export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
//     export GCLOUD_PROJECT=schedulingapp-88727
//     node functions/scripts/backfill-client-name-with-phone.js
//
//   Options:
//     --dry-run          report what would change, write nothing
//     --since=YYYY-MM-DD skip clients created on or after this date
//                        (default 2026-08-08; pass --since=9999-01-01 to
//                        include every client regardless of age)
//
// AN UNKNOWN ARGUMENT IS A HARD ERROR, and that is about `--dry-run`
// specifically: it is matched exactly, so `--dryrun` or `--dry_run` would
// otherwise read as false and take the run LIVE. Every typo of the safety flag
// now fails before a document is read.
//
// It prints the TARGET PROJECT before reading anything — running this against
// the wrong project is the other unrecoverable mistake, and that banner is the
// only thing standing in the way.
//
// A crash mid-run leaves the earlier batches committed. That is safe: the
// rename is idempotent, so re-running finishes the job and re-writes nothing
// it already did.
//
// ALWAYS dry-run against prod first and READ THE SAMPLE plus the two warning
// lists at the end. This rewrites the customer name in Wave; it is not
// reversible from here.
