 *

 * time, so it cannot be `require()`d outside the emulator. Everything here
 * takes its I/O as injected deps instead, which is the same split
 * `notification_policy` / `notification_utils` already use.
 *
 * This module is the one place the purge's three load-bearing rules live:
 * the status gate, the images-before-doc ordering, and the loop's
 * termination. All three delete data irreversibly if they regress.
