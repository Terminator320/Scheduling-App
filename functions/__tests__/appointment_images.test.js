/**
 * @fileoverview Tests the orchestration bodies behind the photo
 * subcollection. All of them take an injected `db`, so none needs the emulator.
 *
 * The cascade is the one that matters most: Firestore does not delete a
 * subcollection with its parent, so if `purgeAppointmentImages` regresses,
 * every appointment delete leaves photo documents orphaned under a parent that
 * no longer exists — invisible in the console, unreachable by every query the
 * app makes, and with nothing anywhere reporting it.
 *
 * The debounce is the one most easily broken into a data bug: it must collapse
 * one photo batch into ONE parent write without ever suppressing the offline
 * queue's replay, which is the only self-heal `pictureCount` has.
 *
 * The claim PROTOCOL — staleness takeover, both fail-open branches, the
 * swallowed release failure, the TTL stamp — belongs to `recount_claim.js` and
 * is pinned by `__tests__/recount_claim.test.js`. What is asserted here is
 * only what this adapter decides: the ledger it claims in, the settle window,
 * the `{skipped, count}` shape, and that the aggregate it hands over is
 * `recountPictures`.
