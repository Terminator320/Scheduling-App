# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.


- **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`) — incompatible / breaking changes.
- **MINOR** (`1.x.0`) — new functionality, backward-compatible.
- **PATCH** (`1.0.x`) — backward-compatible bug fixes only.

The `+N` build number after the version (e.g. `1.1.0+5`) is the store version
code; it increments by one on every store upload regardless of the semver part.

## [1.1.0+5] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- First-launch onboarding carousel, shown once and gated by an encrypted
  `onboardingSeen` flag (`smooth_page_indicator`).
- Biometric app-lock that gates the whole app on cold start and resume
  (`local_auth`), toggled from Settings and stored as an encrypted flag.
- Appointment image carousel and in-app camera capture, with runtime camera
  permission handling (`permission_handler`).
- Paginated clients list with infinite scroll (`infinite_scroll_pagination`).
- Encrypted at-rest secure storage for cached identity and remembered login
  email (`flutter_secure_storage`).
- App version display in Settings.

### Changed
- Performance and security hardening pass across the codebase (durable
  Firestore-backed rate limiting on auth callables, callable payload
  sanitization, and related cleanup).
- Code-structure simplification and documentation of plugin features in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Fixed
- Appointment card no longer crashes when viewing events on other days. The
  card's `IntrinsicHeight` (which stretches the employee-color bar) could not
  compute intrinsic dimensions through `AutoSizeText`'s internal `LayoutBuilder`,
  which surfaced in release builds as a paint-time `Null check operator used on
  a null value`. The title is now a plain `Text`.

## [1.0.3+4] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- Account deletion reliability and an accompanying Firestore security-rules
  update.

## [1.0.2+3] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Adaptive / responsive layout, native splash screen, and app launcher icons.
- Full English/French localization via `gen_l10n` with `@key` metadata.

### Changed
- Hardcoded values refactored into design tokens and localized strings.

### Fixed
- Sign-up errors no longer collapse into a generic message in release builds.

## [1.0.0+1] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Initial release: appointment scheduling, client records, employee management,
  and photo documentation, backed by Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage,
  App Check).
